# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-local-lib: This module provides a quick, convenient way of
perl-local-lib: bootstrapping a user-local Perl module library located
perl-local-lib: within the perl-local-lib: user's home directory. It also
perl-local-lib: constructs and prints out for the user the list of
perl-local-lib: environment variables using the syntax appropriate for the
perl-local-lib: user's current shell (as specified by the SHELL
perl-local-lib: environment variable), suitable for directly adding to
perl-local-lib: one's shell configuration file.

Beware, in the queue, for avahi and google-go-lang :
- avahi : create avahi user and group before building
# groupadd -g 214 avahi
# useradd -u 214 -g 214 -c Avahi -d /dev/null -s /bin/false avahi
- google-go-lang : after the build put it in the path otherwise fzf will fail to build
# export PATH=$PATH:"/usr/share/gocode"
# export GOPATH="$HOME"


ZZIPLIB is activated in MPD and in the queue

ncmpcpp is in the queue even if optional for the real benefit of clerk

PYTHON3 is at yes when possible

The queue file is intended to bring the more options given. You'd better build the entire queue files
since they are called from each others.
